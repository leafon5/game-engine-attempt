# Game Engine Attempt

This is the repo where I will try (for the 8th time) to make a game engine using OpenGL (and SFML for window management). 
I'm gonna be doing this through the whole summer, starting from now, 9th June. (~11 weeks)
Wish me luck on this journey, all my progress will be stored in the `./progress/` folder
