# Game Engine Attempt

This is the repo where I will try (for the 8th time) to make a game engine using OpenGL (and SFML for window management). 
I'm gonna be doing this through the whole summer, starting from now, 9th June. (~11 weeks)
Wish me luck on this journey, all my progress will be stored in the `./progress/` folder

Also the guide i'm following is this one: http://www.opengl-tutorial.org, but i ask a lot of questions to chatGPT sooo yea. However some important notes will be in the progress folder, you could check that out if it helps you.
